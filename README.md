# rn_delivery

To try this application just download, run npm i , in ios folder run pod install, and run it.

Just a few steps i would like to improve if the deadline would be with a few more days.


1. Write a best test coverage, i was able to write a few tests, and i like to deliver features/components, etc... well tested.
2. Maybe use TypeScript, as the app was small i decided not to use it, but in a larger app i think is a good choice.
